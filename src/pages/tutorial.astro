        The tutorial TUTSTI introduces the topic of Semantic Table
        Interpretation (STI), covering theoretical and practical considerations.
        In particular, the tutorial will provide a comprehensive analysis of how
        the approaches to STI have evolved from heuristic-based to ML-based, to
        the most recent LLM-based approaches. The analysis will consider the
        specific characteristics of these different classes, providing insights
        into their respective advantages and limitations to identify the
        contexts of use. The final part will describe a case study to
        demonstrate the application of two state-of-the-art approaches. A
        comprehensive survey of all STI approaches developed up to October 2024
        is available <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.11891?">here</a>.
